Time to run code with unshift(): 55.5 microsecond

The .push() function appears to be faster when used on the extraLargeArray, largeArray and the mediumArray 
but the .unshift() method became faster when used on the smallArray and tinyArray. 
This is because the numbers in the array that needs to be shifted back so the .unshift() method can add a new number to the beginning of the array has 
greatly reduced in the smallArray and tinyArray compared to the other arrays where the .push() method just needs to add new results to the end of the numbers in the array
